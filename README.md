# PatchDay
This is a transdermal patch medication monitoring app.

PatchDay is a schedule app for hormone replacement therapy. 
Originally purposed to solve problems with patch staggering, PatchDay became a full H.R.T. companion.

Patch staggering means placing multiple transdermal patches on the body at different times. 
All of those sites and dates require a method to schedule them, and PatchDay is our proposition.

PatchDay is best suited for medications with transdermal or injection delivery methods because here twice-a-week means lasting 168 hours post the user placing the patch. 
Injections are similar - the medicine is absorbed into the body at a rate until a re-dose is needed. 
Twice-a-week is not just "every Tuesday and Friday". 
If a patch's date is 4pm on Tuesday, it technically expires at 4am on Friday, 
and that is early in the morning and something we think should be easy to consider.

PatchDay exists as an application for patch staggering as well the optimization of site scheduling. 
That is why we made it so that "changing a patch" or "injecting an injection" 
(recording the site, date, and time and scheduling a notification) 
is as easy as the tapping of a single button.

Even though there is only one injection at a time, user research shows that after two weeks of time, 
many people have difficulties remembering which bodily site was injected last. 
We at PatchDay saw this an oppurtunity to become a full H.R.T. app. For the same reason, 
we included a daily timestamp-based pill schedule as well.

PatchDay is a scheduling app optimized for H.R.T., and it was made by a transgender woman. 
However, it is universally a medication schedule app for anyone to use. 
Also, we want to be better! Tell us what you think.

# Estrogens

The estrogen schedule is the main view of the application. 
To change the delivery method (patches or injections) as well as other settings, tap the gear in the top right.
If using patches, the patches are sorted from oldest to newest (top to bottom).
If using injections, there will only be one estrogen button in the schedule.
Expiration dates are listed beneath each estrogen button.
The site images on the buttons reflect the bodily sites where the patches are placed, 
or in the case of injections, the last place injected. They could also be a blankish image instead.

Tap the images in the schedule to re-dose.

Use "Autofill" to set 'date and time placed' to the current date and time. 
"Auotfill" also sets 'site' to the next available site in the site schedule. 
If there are no sites available in the site schedule, 
whether the user is not using that feature or there are equal number of patches to sites, 
the site will not change. Also, the user could edit the estrogen attributes individually. T
his is useful if there was a mistake.

# Pills

When did you last take each pill?
When do you need to take the next pill?
Tap the pill cell to edit the pill attributes, such as the name and the times per day it is taken.
The 'take' button is how to stamp the pill as taken. If the pill is past due, the 'take' button will have a notification bubble.

# Sites

The site schedule is a user-customizable ordering of bodily sites for patches to be placed or injections injected. 
This helps keep PatchDay quick and easy to use. 
For example, say the user gets a patch-expired notification. 
This notification will mention where to place the next patch and a button to change it directly from the notification.
How does PatchDay know the site? 
It is all based on this site schedule and the fact the each row can only be occupied by one estrogen at a time. 
Want multiple estrogens on the same site or to be replaced at the same site after changing? 
Easy. Just make two of the same sites in the site schedule! The possibilities are endless.

The site schedule is also good for merely renaming sites. 
For example, rename the default "Right Abdomen" to "R-Tummy" or anything else. 
Also, change it's a picture if you like.
