# Estrogens

The estrogen schedule is the main view of the application. 
To change the delivery method (patches or injections) as well as other settings, tap the gear in the top right.
If using patches, the patches are sorted from oldest to newest (top to bottom).
If using injections, there will only be one estrogen button in the schedule.
Expiration dates are listed beneath each estrogen button.
The site images on the buttons reflect the bodily sites where the patches are placed, 
or in the case of injections, the last place injected. They could also be a blankish image instead.

Tap the images in the schedule to re-dose.

Use "Autofill" to set 'date and time placed' to the current date and time. 
"Auotfill" also sets 'site' to the next available site in the site schedule. 
If there are no sites available in the site schedule, 
whether the user is not using that feature or there are equal number of patches to sites, 
the site will not change. Also, the user could edit the estrogen attributes individually. T
his is useful if there was a mistake.

  Delivery Method: Either patches or injections. Refers to how estrogen enters your body.

  Schedule: How long until next dose.

  Count: How many patches are in the schedule. For injections, it's always 1.

  Notifications: Receive a notification to take next dose.

  Minutes prior: How many minutes before expiration to receive notification.

# Pills

When did you last take each pill?
When do you need to take the next pill?
Tap the pill cell to edit the pill attributes, such as the name and the times per day it is taken.
The 'take' button is how to stamp the pill as taken. If the pill is past due, the 'take' button will have a notification bubble.

# Sites

The site schedule is a user-customizable ordering of bodily sites for patches to be placed or injections injected. 
This helps keep PatchDay quick and easy to use. 
For example, say the user gets a patch-expired notification. 
This notification will mention where to place the next patch and a button to change it directly from the notification.
How does PatchDay know the site? 
It is all based on this site schedule and the fact the each row can only be occupied by one estrogen at a time. 
Want multiple estrogens on the same site or to be replaced at the same site after changing? 
Easy. Just make two of the same sites in the site schedule! The possibilities are endless.

The site schedule is also good for merely renaming sites. 
For example, rename the default "Right Abdomen" to "R-Tummy" or anything else. 
Also, change it's a picture if you like.
